## AI Response

The `tee` command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems is used to read from standard input and write to both standard output and one or more files simultaneously. Essentially, it "tees off" the input stream, sending it in two directions: to the terminal (or another output stream) and to a file (or multiple files).

### Syntax:
```bash
tee [options] [file(s)]
```

### How it works:
- `tee` takes input from a pipe or standard input.
- It duplicates the input and sends it to:
  - The standard output (usually the terminal).
  - One or more specified files.

### Common Use Cases:
1. **Save output to a file while displaying it on the terminal:**
   When you run a command and want to see the output on the screen while also saving it to a file, `tee` is very handy.
   ```bash
   ls -l | tee output.txt
   ```
   In this example:
   - The output of `ls -l` is displayed on the terminal.
   - The same output is also written to `output.txt`.

2. **Write to multiple files:**
   You can specify multiple files to write the output to.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!" | tee file1.txt file2.txt
   ```
   Here, "Hello, World!" is written to both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, and also displayed on the terminal.

3. **Append to a file instead of overwriting:**
   By default, `tee` overwrites the specified file(s). Use the `-a` (append) option to append the output to the file(s) instead.
   ```bash
   echo "New line" | tee -a output.txt
   ```

### Common Options:
- `-a`: Append to the specified file(s) instead of overwriting.
- `-i`: Ignore interrupt signals (e.g., Ctrl+C).

### Example with a Pipeline:
If you're processing data in a pipeline and want to save intermediate results, `tee` can help:
```bash
cat input.txt | grep "error" | tee errors.txt | wc -l
```
In this example:
- `cat input.txt` reads the file.
- `grep "error"` filters lines containing "error".
- `tee errors.txt` saves the filtered output to `errors.txt` and also passes it to the next command.
- `wc -l` counts the number of matching lines.

### Summary:
The `tee` command is a powerful tool for duplicating output streams, allowing you to both display and save command output simultaneously. It’s especially useful for debugging, logging, or when you need to process data in a pipeline while keeping a copy of intermediate results.
